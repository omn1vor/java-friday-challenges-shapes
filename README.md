# java-friday-challenges-shapes
A program that determines if several shapes form single new shape or not.

Java Challenge 22
Write a Java program that accepts input of simple shapes in a human readable text file, including rectangles, squares and circles. The program should check if a complex shape made up of these simple shapes presents a single-connected shape and, if yes, calculate its area and perimeter.
- Rectangle and square edges are always parallel to the coordinate axes
- All values are assumed floating point double values, using fp calculatons and tolerance when needed is acceptable
- Square is described with x, y and w
- Rectangle is described with x, y, w and h
- Circle is described with x, y and r
- The configuration language is at your discretion. It should contain the list of shapes that need to be considered as one single-connected shape

We are going to accept partial solutions, a complete solution that arrives first wins by default. We are also going to take into account code elegance and adhering OOP principles for the best solution nomination.
